			<p>My first foray into web development was customizing my MySpace portfolio in my early teens. In high school, I took an elective in HTML and learned more of the basics. I started my degree at Montana Tech, then transferred to Baker College in Michigan (where I moved to be with my fiance) and received my AAS in Web Development in 2014.</p>

			<p>My first real web development position was at Verde Media in Ferndale, MI. I was hired on to replace the owner as developer so that he could focus on marketing and sales, and quickly surpassed his development skills. I helped to grow the company over the four years that I worked there, and was the sole developer for the first three. I worked remotely for a few months while the company (still very young when I started) built up enough capital to justify a dedicated office. I mentored a junior employee for about a year, helping her to grow her web development and WordPress skills.</p>

			<p>My duties at Verde Media mainly included translating PSD mockups into custom WordPress themes for small to medium sized businesses. I also communicated with clients directly via email to discuss support issues and feature requests.</p>

			<p>I love web development because I love to build things. In my spare time, I like to do pretty much anything creative, be it painting, drawing, playing keyboard, hoop dancing, writing, baking, sculpting, photography, or sewing (view my <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/radrei/gallery" target="_blank">deviantart</a> here). In fact, I painted the cat logo on this site, and made the hero banner in photoshop and illustrator. I also like to run, surf the internet, watch horror movies, and play video games (Zelda, Pokemon, and Kirby are my favorite franchises). I am the oldest of 6 children, with my youngest siblings (twins) being a whopping 19 years younger than me. I love animals, my favorites being cats, dogs, birds, and turtles.</p>
